# Research Proposal: Multilingual Multi-Modal Item Matching in Lost & Found Systems

## Abstract

This research proposal outlines a comprehensive study on developing and evaluating advanced AI-powered matching algorithms for trilingual lost and found systems. The research focuses on optimizing multi-modal fusion techniques combining natural language processing, computer vision, geospatial analysis, and temporal modeling to improve item matching accuracy in multilingual environments.

## 1. Research Background and Motivation

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Traditional lost and found systems rely on manual categorization and basic keyword matching, leading to low recovery rates and poor user experience.
