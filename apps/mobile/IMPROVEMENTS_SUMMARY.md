## üéØ Benefits

1. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging system makes it easier to identify and fix issues
2. **Improved Reliability**: Multiple connectivity checks and retry mechanisms
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Better error messages and offline handling
4. **Easier Development**: Test screen allows quick connectivity verification
5. **Better Monitoring**: Real-time connectivity status and performance metrics
6. **Robust Error Handling**: Centralized error processing with context-aware logging

## üß™ Testing

The app now includes a dedicated test screen accessible at `/test-connectivity` that allows you to:

- Test basic network connectivity
- Test API endpoint connectivity
- Test authentication endpoint connectivity
- View detailed test results
- Access debug logs
- Monitor real-time connectivity status

## üì± Usage

1. **Run the app** and navigate to the test screen
2. **Use the test buttons** to verify connectivity
3. **Check debug logs** for detailed information
4. **Monitor connectivity status** in real-time
5. **Use the improved error handling** throughout the app

## üîç Monitoring

All services now provide comprehensive logging and monitoring:

- API requests and responses are logged
- Authentication events are tracked
- Network connectivity changes are monitored
- Error occurrences are logged with context
- Performance metrics are collected

This comprehensive improvement ensures the mobile app has robust backend connectivity, excellent debugging capabilities, and reliable error handling.
