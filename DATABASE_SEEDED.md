## üìä Database Verification Commands

### Check Total Counts

```sql
-- Total users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
-- Expected: 21

-- Total reports
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reports;
-- Expected: 30

-- Reports by type
SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM reports GROUP BY type;
-- Expected: LOST=15, FOUND=15

-- Reports by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM reports GROUP BY status;
-- Expected: APPROVED‚âà19, PENDING‚âà11
```

### Sample Data Queries

```sql
-- Get all electronics
SELECT title, type, status FROM reports
WHERE category = 'Electronics';

-- Get pending reports
SELECT title, type, category FROM reports
WHERE status = 'PENDING';

-- Get reports with rewards
SELECT title, description FROM reports
WHERE reward_offered = TRUE;
```

## üìù Notes

- All reports have realistic titles and descriptions
- Date ranges span last 60 days for testing date filters
- Locations include major Sri Lankan cities
- Some reports marked as resolved for testing workflows
- Database uses UUID for all IDs (consistent with models)
- Geo column is TEXT (PostGIS not enabled - feature to be added later)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If You Need to Re-seed

**Clear all reports:**

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE reports CASCADE;
```

**Re-run seeding script:**

```powershell
Get-Content c:\Users\td123\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\lost-found\seed_reports.sql | docker exec -i lost-found-db psql -U postgres -d lostfound
```

### If Authentication Fails

- Verify API is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check JWT token expiration
- Try logging in with fresh credentials

### If No Data Appears

- Check database connection
- Verify reports table has data: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reports;`
- Check API endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/v1/reports`
